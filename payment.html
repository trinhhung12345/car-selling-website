        <h2>Collateral when taking out an installment car loan</h2>
        <p>  When buying a car on installments in the form of a mortgage loan, there are two main types of collateral:  the car itself, or other assets that the car owner owns
            such as real estate, savings books, etc. Buying a car on installment can choose one of these two types as collateral for the installment loan.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Mortgage by the very own car</h2>
        <p> Faster and Simpler procedures, however the bank or the financial institution will keep the original Automobile
            Registration Certificate until you paid off your debt, at that point you will receive the original
            Certification. You will be able to use the a certified copy of the Certificate or the original copy of credit
            institution’s receipt (as long as it’s still valid) as substitute of the original Certification. You cannot
            loan 100% value of the car neither, usually the bank will only lend you 70-80% of the value meaning you will
            have to pay the rest yourself</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Mortgage by other properties</h2>
        <p> Common collateral include real estate,saving books,… The collateral’s value must be more than the car’s value.
            You will be able to loan 100% of the car’s value without prepayment along with being able to keep the original
            Automobile Registration Certificate
            Combine to choose both types of mortgage:
            In some case the bank will let you combine two methods of mortgage. This usually happen when the buyer want
            to loan 100% of the car’s value but instead of mortgaging properties with big value the loaner will mortgage
            the car along with small value collateral like saving books,… As long as the total value of the collateral is
            higher than the car’s value the bank will approve a load of 100% of the car value.


            It is necessary for the buyer to prove their monthly income to the bank for the approval of the loan.
            The income can come from salary, renting properties, business,…

            The loaning percentage is usually based on the car’s value or a specific amount. Currently, for car loans, t
            he maximum loan limit in banks is usually: 70% - 80% of the car value with new cars; 75% of car value with used car.
            Installment car loans amount is usually based on the selling price announced by the seller minus sales(if any) and
            not including taxes, insurance…

            Each bank will have different loan period that the buyer will need to pay attention to. Normally the loan term will
            last up to 7-8 years for new cars and 5-6 years for used car while the minimum is around 6 months to 1 year.
            The longer the load term the less the monthly payment will be however the interest rate will be higher while a
            shorter term will have less interest in exchange for bigger monthly payment.
            There are 2 types of interest rate for car loan installment
            Fixed interest rate
            The interest rate is fixed and will remain the same during the entire load period
            Floating interest rate
            The interest rate is adjusted based on the market’s interest rate. The interest rate can be adjusted once every 3 months/6 months/1 year.
            It should be noted that unlike small value properties like fridge, computer ,cellphones,…  car is a big value property with the ability to retain its value well therefore there is no car installment package with 0% interest rate.
            Principal balance (initial balance)
            With the principal balance interest calculation method, the interest will be calculated based on the original loan amount and applied fixed for all months. When choosing how to calculate the principal interest, the interest will not change. This interest rate calculation usually applies to fixed interest rates.
            Debt balance decreases gradually
            With the method of calculating the interest rate on the reducing balance, the interest will be calculated based on the actual remaining debt at each time (principal - principal paid), not the interest rate calculated on the entire loan amount. When you choose to calculate the declining balance interest rate, the interest will gradually decrease because the principal amount also decreases over time. This interest rate calculation usually applies to floating interest rates.
